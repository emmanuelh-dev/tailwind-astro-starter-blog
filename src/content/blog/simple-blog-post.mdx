There is already a template for Next.js, and I thought, why not create a starter kit in the framework that is designed for delivering static content? The goal of this blog is to have a blog with the lightest and fastest framework of all (it's data). Next.js is good, but it's like using a shotgun to kill ducks, whereas Astro is perfect.
